# CA01
Project Overview

This project focuses on cleaning, exploring, and analyzing a real-world dataset using Python. The goal is to apply core data analytics concepts covered in class—data preparation, exploratory analysis, and interpretation of results—while clearly documenting the analytical process.

This README is written for classmates and teammates who want to understand what was done and why, not to rerun or extend the code.

Tools & Technologies

Python

pandas

numpy

matplotlib / seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

Workflow Summary

The notebook follows a structured analytics workflow:

1. Data Loading

Imported the dataset into a pandas DataFrame

Inspected column names, data types, and overall structure

2. Data Cleaning & Preparation

Handled missing or inconsistent values

Standardized column formats and data types

Removed or corrected problematic records where necessary

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Generated summary statistics to understand distributions

Created visualizations to identify trends, patterns, and outliers

Compared key variables relevant to the project question

4. Analysis & Insights

Interpreted patterns found in the data

Connected findings back to the analytical objective

Highlighted notable relationships and anomalies

5. Conclusions

Summarized the main takeaways from the analysis

Discussed what the results suggest in a real-world context

Key Takeaways

The dataset required meaningful preprocessing before analysis

Visual exploration was essential in revealing trends not obvious from raw tables

The analysis demonstrates how structured data cleaning directly improves insight quality

Assumptions & Limitations

Results are limited by the quality and scope of the original dataset

Findings are descriptive and exploratory, not causal

Some variables may contain reporting or measurement bias

File Contents

CA01.ipynb – Jupyter Notebook containing all code, visualizations, and explanations

README.md – High-level summary of the project

Notes for Teammates

This project is meant to be read, not extended. All explanations are embedded directly in the notebook alongside the code to make the logic easy to follow for non-technical readers.

If you’re reviewing this for class, focus on:

The clarity of the workflow

The reasoning behind cleaning decisions

How insights are supported by visuals
